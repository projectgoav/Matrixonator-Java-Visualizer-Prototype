Matrixonator-Visualizer

Connection : Visualizer is a one-way, fire-and-forget communication platform for Matrixonator.
When the matrixonator has done some operation, data from this is pumped out, allowing for add-ons
to recieve and display this data in some format.

On startup - the internals are setup and a thread is spawned waiting for something to connect to the
visualizer output through sockets. Once a client has been connected, the thread stops and the client is
able to recieve the output from the program.

When the program shuts, a special close message is sent to notify that Matrixonator has shut.
